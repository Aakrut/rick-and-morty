Bunch of people running around bumping into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue. What do they actually teach you in school that you end up using in life? Absolutely nothing.",
